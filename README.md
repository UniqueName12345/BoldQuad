Imagine LibreWolf but with more updates and less guarantees? Yeah, this is it.

### Important

The build scripts are currently meant to be run in a CI environment with Docker containers
and gitlab-runners. Updated instructions for local builds or setting up your own
appropriate runners will be provided again in the future.


## Other builds
Currently none! If you want a build, please open an issue or pull request.
In the meanwhile, if you want a windows version, you can run WSL with Docker.
